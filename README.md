# Implementation of Edmond_Karp algorithm
Edmonds-Karp algorithm is just an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method that uses BFS for finding augmenting paths. 
The algorithm was first published by Yefim Dinitz in 1970, and later independently published by Jack Edmonds and Richard Karp in 1972.

Integral flow theorem
The theorem simply says, that if every capacity in the network is integer, then the flow in each edge will be integer in the maximal flow.
